Write SQL statements to
1. Prepare a list with salesman name, customer name and their cities for the salesmen and customer who
belongs to the same city.
2. Display the salesman who is not associated with any customer
3. Make a list with order no, purchase amount, customer name and their cities for those orders which order
amount between 700 and 2000.
4. Know which salesman is working for which customer.
5. Find the list of customers who appointed a salesman for their jobs who gets a commission from the
company is more than 12%.
6. Find the list of customers who appointed a salesman for their jobs who does not live in the same city
where their customer lives, and gets a commission is above 12%
7. Find the details of an order i.e. order number, order date, amount of order, which customer gives the
order and which salesman works for that customer and how much commission he gets for an order.
8. Make a join on the tables: salesman, customer and orders in such a form that the same column of each
table will appear once and only the relational rows will come.
9. Make a list in ascending order for the customer who holds a grade less than 250 and works either through
a salesman or by own.
10. Make a list in ascending order for the salesmen who work either for one or more customer or not yet
join under any of the customers.
11. Make a list for the salesmen who work either for one or more customer or not yet join under any of the
customers who placed either one or more orders or no order to their supplier.
12. Make a Cartesian product between salesman and customer i.e. each salesman will appear for all
customers and vice versa.
